## Hey there, fellow coders! 👋

I'm Nils, a passionate UX engineer with a knack for transforming ideas from paper to production code.

- 💻 Currently, I'm part of the talented team at [inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang), shaping the future of open-source globalization infrastructure. My ultimate goal is to ship fast and deliver tangible value to products with a deep influence on growth topics and metrics.

- 🎓 Was studying **Interaction Design** at *HfG Schwaebisch Gmuend*. I was also a former **Electrical Engineer** at Mercedes Benz.

- ⚡️ I find developer communities to be the weirdest & most fascinating subculture, which is why I've dedicated myself to building developer tools like [inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang), [stage](https://github.com/stagehq/), [melo](https://melo-sound.com/), and [zirkular](https://www.zirkular.dev/).

- 🔧 **Tools & Technologies**: Nextjs, Solidjs, TypeScript, JavaScript, Figma, and a sprinkle of magic ✨

- 🌟 In my free time, I'm all about running & hiking, meeting fellow designers and developers, and exploring our beautiful planet. Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-jacobsen/)!
